Let's say I have risky investment that has the potential for a yearly gain of 12% and 10% chance I could lose 30% in a given year.  Lets also assume that in the portfolio that I don't invest in the risky investment I can get 3% yearly return.  How much should I invest in the risky investment if I wish to make 6% return total and do not wish to lose more than 5% on my portfolio in a given year.  What would be my expected yearly rate of return with this allocation and maximum drawndown?
