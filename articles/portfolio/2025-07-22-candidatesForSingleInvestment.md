### Choosing Your Champion: A Guide to Investing in a Single Growth Asset

The strategy is to balance our chosen champion with a totally safe investment that yields 3% annually. The personal risk tolerance—the maximum you're willing to lose in a bad year—will determine how much to allocate to the champion.

My goal is to see which single asset provides the most attractive and reliable outcome over a 10-year period.

#### The Three Contenders

I will analyze three of the most popular exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as potential champions:

1.  **SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY):** The "Broad Market" champion. By investing in 500 of the largest U.S. companies, it represents the U.S. economy as a whole.
2.  **Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ):** The "Growth" champion. It focuses on the 100 largest, most innovative non-financial companies, with a heavy emphasis on the technology sector.
3.  **SPDR Gold Shares (GLD):** The "Safe Haven" champion. Gold is a physical asset that investors often turn to during times of economic uncertainty or inflation.

#### The Head-to-Head Comparison

Below is a direct comparison showing how a portfolio would perform over 10 years depending on which champion you choose and the level of risk you are willing to take.

| Your Risk Tolerance (Max Loss Cap) | 0% (Risk-Free) | 5% (Conservative) | 10% (Balanced) | 15% (Aggressive) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **--- IF YOUR CHAMPION IS SPY (S&P 500) ---** |
| **Allocation to SPY** | **0%** | 20% | 33% | 45% |
| **Expected Yearly Return** | **3.00%** | 4.47% | 5.39% | 6.31% |
| **Expected 10-Year Total Gain** | **+34%** | **+55%** | **+70%** | **+85%** |
| **"Unlucky" 10-Year Outcome*** | **+34%** | **+15%** | **+5%** | **-5%** |
| **--- IF YOUR CHAMPION IS QQQ (NASDAQ-100) ---** |
| **Allocation to QQQ** | **0%** | 18% | 28% | 38% |
| **Expected Yearly Return** | **3.00%** | 4.69% | 5.64% | 6.59% |
| **Expected 10-Year Total Gain** | **+34%** | **+59%** | **+73%** | **+88%** |
| **"Unlucky" 10-Year Outcome*** | **+34%** | **+10%** | **-7%** | **-21%** |
| **--- IF YOUR CHAMPION IS GLD (GOLD) ---** |
| **Allocation to GLD** | **0%** | 16% | 32% | 48% |
| **Expected Yearly Return** | **3.00%** | 3.65% | 4.31% | 4.97% |
| **Expected 10-Year Total Gain** | **+34%** | **+43%** | **+53%** | **+63%** |
| **"Unlucky" 10-Year Outcome*** | **+34%** | **+16%** | **-1%** | **-15%** |

#### Breaking Down the Results: The Story in the Numbers

By comparing these three paths, a clear narrative emerges.

1.  **Gold (GLD) as a Primary Grower Falls Short:** While often considered "safe," gold is quite volatile. The table shows that it produces the lowest "Expected" returns at every risk level. Worse, its "Unlucky" outcome leads to a loss of capital over 10 years even at a balanced risk tolerance. Gold can be a valuable ingredient in a diversified basket, but as a sole champion, it offers a poor trade-off of risk and reward.

2.  **The Main Event: SPY vs. QQQ:**
    *   **The Allure of QQQ:** Looking at the "Expected 10-Year Gain," QQQ consistently shows slightly higher numbers than SPY. This reflects its higher growth potential, which is very appealing.
    *   **The Price of That Growth:** Now look at the "Unlucky" outcome row. This is where the decision becomes clear. For the "Balanced" investor (10% max loss), the QQQ portfolio has an unlucky outcome of **-7%**. The SPY portfolio, at the same risk level, still ends with a positive gain of **+5%**. The difference is even more stark for the "Aggressive" investor, where the QQQ portfolio could lead to a painful **-21%** loss over the decade.

#### The Final Recommendation: Simplicity and Prudence Point to SPY

If you are committed to the simplicity of choosing a single champion for your portfolio's growth, this analysis points to a clear winner: **the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY).**

While QQQ offers a slightly higher potential reward, it comes with a significantly higher risk of a disappointing long-term outcome. The SPY provides the best balance for a single-asset strategy, capturing the powerful growth of the broad U.S. economy while offering more robust protection against an "unlucky" decade. It keeps you in the game, allowing your capital to compound without the severe long-term setbacks that more volatile assets can inflict.

While a diversified basket (as discussed previously) may be theoretically optimal, if your goal is simplicity, choosing SPY as your champion is a prudent and powerful strategy for the long run.

`*` **A Note on the Odds and the "Unlucky Decade":**
The chance of your final result being **worse than the "Unlucky Outcome"** shown above is approximately **16%, or about 1 in 6.** This means that for any of these strategies, there is a real and foreseeable chance of a disappointing decade. An "unlucky" journey doesn't just mean a single big crash; it can also be caused by a long, flat market or by wild swings that erode your returns over time. Knowing these odds is key to choosing a path you can stick with.
